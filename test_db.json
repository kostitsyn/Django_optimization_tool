Afterwards, the action shifts to June 6, 1944, with Martin forced to undertake a solo mission to establish a landing zone for soldiers participating in Operation Overlord. Under heavy fire, the paratroopers are scattered, leaving Martin in a mixed unit formed from various companies led by his CO Cpt. Foley. The mission closes with Martin and his allies seizing a nearby town from German forces. In the second mission, Martin and his unit are sent to drive out the remaining Germans from Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise and disable several Flakpanzers (anti-aircraft tanks) as the events of June 6 begin (D-Day). A paratrooper is seen hanging from the town church. The third mission occurs later that morning, with U.S. forces fending off a German counterattack. The fourth mission has Martin, Pvt. Elder of the 82nd Airborne and Sgt. Moody driving from Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont along highway N13 to deliver an important message, while fending off German assaults. The fifth mission, the Br\u00e9court Manor Assault, occurs on the evening of June 6, with Martin's unit destroying German artillery positions attacking the landing force at Utah Beach. After the mission, Martin learns that his unit has been assigned to several secret missions. The first occurs in the sixth mission, with Martin participating in an attack on a secret German prison in the basement of a Bavarian manor to rescue two British officers, Captain Price and Major Ingram. He then learns from Price that Ingram had already been moved to a more secure POW camp for interrogation. Thus, the seventh mission has Martin, accompanied by Price, infiltrating the camp and rescuing Ingram in under ten minutes before the arrival of German reinforcements.", "price": "2.94", "quantity": 500, "is_active": true}}, {"model": "mainapp.games", "pk": 22, "fields": {"game_category": 3, "name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell", "image": "game_images/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell.jpg", "description": "The primary focus and hallmark of Splinter Cell's gameplay is stealth, with strong emphasis on light and darkness.

Mission objectives vary in their requirements, ranging from having the player arrive at a particular checkpoint, to eliminating enemies in a specified location, to standing their ground against enemy squadrons, directing remote-operated weapons, and planting explosive charges on enemy installations. The player is also accompanied by fellow soldiers who cannot be issued orders. Like its predecessor, the game includes an interactive scene of a terror attack against civilians, which the player is given the option of skipping due to the portrayal of graphic and potentially upsetting content, including harm to children.", "price": "14.44", "old_price": "28.90", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "mainapp.contacts", "pk": 1, "fields": {"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages sed do, At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio digs qui blanditiis", "address": "Leningradsky AVE 39, BLDG 79\nMOSCOW 125 167, Russia", "phone": "+00 111 222 3333", "fax": "+1 888 888 4444", "email": "mail@example.com", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "authapp.shopuser", "pk": 1, "fields": {"password": "pbkdf2_sha256$150000$okAfvRgJDVft$4VGKYLN2XxBTKo07j4OPoWa85KGltqiMszMtPrS2mu4=", "last_login": "2020-11-17T14:00:23.179Z", "is_superuser": true, "username": "django", "first_name": "django", "last_name": "", "is_staff": false, "is_active": true, "date_joined": "2020-10-15T05:29:45.895Z", "avatar": "users_avatars/angela_iTcaG6z_PDLLZlM_VR0vpAr.jpeg", "age": 28, "email": "mail@example.com", "activation_key": "", "activation_key_expires": "2020-10-24T12:31:07.462Z", "groups": [], "user_permissions": []}}, {"model": "authapp.shopuser", "pk": 2, "fields": {"password": "pbkdf2_sha256$150000$ot7UWD6jwH5v$tfRclvXv9OB6WrYPrHvpKz0NRfHxCL8FclJCJR8NQQ4=", "last_login": "2020-10-23T14:05:01.234Z", "is_superuser": false, "username": "test_a", "first_name": "test_a", "last_name": "", "is_staff": false, "is_active": true, "date_joined": "2020-10-23T14:04:55.034Z", "avatar": "", "age": 28, "email": "django@geekshop.local", "activation_key": "c1a54fb4cd1c34b9168c2ea09f8c4dd3e3c23825", "activation_key_expires": "2020-10-25T14:04:21.230Z", "groups": [], "user_permissions": []}}, {"model": "authapp.shopuserprofile", "pk": 1, "fields": {"user": 1, "tagline": "", "about_me": "", "gender": ""}}, {"model": "authapp.shopuserprofile", "pk": 2, "fields": {"user": 2, "tagline": "", "about_me": "", "gender": ""}}]
